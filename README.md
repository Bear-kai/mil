# One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning via Meta-Learning

*A TensorFlow implementation of the paper [One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning via Meta-Learning (Finn*, Yu* et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04905.pdf).* Here are the instructions to run our experiments shown in the paper.

First clone the fork of the gym repo found [here](https://github.com/tianheyu927/gym), and following the instructions there to install gym. Switch to branch *mil*.

Then training and testing scripts for MIL are available in `scripts/`.

*Note 1: Data including demonstrations for all experiments and texture files for running the pushing experiment are coming soon.*

*Note 2: The code only includes the simulated experiments.*
